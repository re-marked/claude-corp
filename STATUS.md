## v2.1.11 — Unify CEO-thread session keys (IN PROGRESS)

Follow-up on the v2.1.10 audit. Three dispatchers were still minting fresh claude sessions every fire — same anti-pattern as v2.1.5's jack-key bug — so every escalation, recovery, and channel @mention reached the target agent as a stranger with zero memory of what came before:

- **`pulse-escalation:${Date.now()}`** → Pulse escalates to the CEO when an agent misses 2 heartbeats. Every escalation minted a new session, so the CEO saw "Herald is unresponsive" but had zero context for what Herald was doing when it died.
- **`pulse-recovery:${Date.now()}`** → Pulse tells the CEO when an escalated agent recovers. Fresh session every time → "Herald is back" arrived in a different thread from "Herald crashed", so the pair read as two disconnected blips.
- **`agent:${model}:channel-${channel.id}-${msg.id}`** → Router @mention. `msg.id` changes per message, so every `@CEO` was session-zero: tools already run, plans mid-flight, prior decisions — all invisible to the very next mention in the same channel.

Fix: pulse escalation + recovery both route into `jack:ceo` (CEO's main thread, where the founder's own conversation lives — the CEO now sees "Herald crashed" and "Herald recovered" as two messages in the same coherent chat, with full memory of the corp's state between them). Router @mention uses `agent:${targetId}:channel-${channel.id}` — scoped per agent + channel so the agent's #general persona builds continuity distinct from its DM thread.

Intentionally left timestamped: `herald-narration:${ts}` and `failsafe-heartbeat:${ts}` — noisy one-off pings that would clog the CEO thread.

Regression test `tests/deterministic-thread-keys.test.ts` pins both rules so a future refactor can't sneak the timestamped form back in. v2.1.11 version bumps bundled into this PR per the post-v2.1.8 bundle-bumps rule.

## v2.1.10 — Multi-block turn rendering (MERGED, PR #121)

A single claude turn (one user prompt → text + tool + text + tool + text response) was rendering as N timestamped chat bubbles in the TUI, making the agent look like it "wakes up fresh" between blocks. Reality: it was one continuous response with tool calls in between.

Fix: stamp every persisted message (text segments + tool events + final result) within a dispatch with the same `metadata.turnId` (generated once per harness dispatch). MessageList groups consecutive same-sender messages with the same turnId into one visual bubble — single header at the top, then text rows + tool rows interleaved inline. Tool events render as compact `│ tool` rows when inside a group.

Stamped in: api.ts `/cc/say` (onAssistantText, onToolEnd, final result.content) + router.ts (segment flush, tool_event, main response, thread response). Messages predating the stamping or from dispatchers that don't set it fall back to per-message bubbles (graceful degradation).

Bonus session-key audit findings (NOT fixed in this PR — separate decision needed):
- `pulse-recovery:<ts>`, `pulse-escalation:<ts>`, `herald-narration:<ts>`, `failsafe-heartbeat:<ts>`, `agent:<...>:channel-<id>-<msgid>` all bake timestamps/per-message ids into the session key, creating a fresh claude session every fire (same anti-pattern as the v2.1.5 jack-key-with-timestamp bug). Worth unifying many of these into the agent's main `jack:<slug>` thread so escalations/mentions land in the conversational context. Pinged Mark for the call.

## v2.1.9 — CEO Gateway Recovery skips harness-mode (MERGED, PR #120)

After a couple of minutes in a fresh claude-code corp, the next dispatch failed with `Agent "CEO" is not online`. Root cause: the CEO Gateway Recovery clock (every 30s) was pinging `http://127.0.0.1:${agentProc.port}/v1/chat/completions` for ALL CEOs, but harness-mode agents have `port: 0` (they dispatch through subprocess, no listening gateway). After 3 failed pings (~90s), the clock marked a perfectly healthy CEO as `crashed`, and the next `/cc/say` rejected the dispatch with "not online".

Fix: early-return from `recoverCeoGateway` when `agentProc.mode === 'harness'`. There's nothing to keep alive between ticks — every dispatch spawns a fresh subprocess. Recovery is the harness's own job.

2 regression tests pin the behavior: no fetch is issued on harness CEO, status stays `ready` after 5 ticks. Without the guard, fetch fires and crash-mark fires.

## v2.1.8 — Trailing-slash encoding fix (MERGED, PR #118)

v2.1.7 still hit "Session ID X is already in use" on cold-boot fresh corps. Root cause: `members.json` stores `agentDir` with a trailing slash (`"agents/ceo/"`), and `api.ts` preserves it through normalisation. `encodeClaudeWorkspacePath` turned the trailing `/` into a trailing `-`, so the encoded dir name didn't match what claude actually wrote — `existsSync` missed, harness fell back to `--session-id` on a UUID claude already owned, claude rejected.

Fix: strip trailing `\`/`/` before applying the char-class substitution. Test table covers all four trailing-separator variants (forward, backslash, multi, mixed) so a future "simplification" of the trim step trips immediately.

Also a personal lesson: when Mark says "you're guessing", verify against the actual built artifact + actual filesystem, not the diff in your head. Took two cycles to land here.

## v2.1.7 — Session scope + error surfacing (MERGED, PR #116)

Fresh corp dispatched "hi" to the CEO → "Claude Code returned an error result", no specifics. Two related bugs:

- **Cross-workspace session UUID collision:** v2.1.1's session check scanned every subdir under `~/.claude/projects/` for the UUID. Jack keys (`jack:ceo`) are identical across corps, so UUIDs collide; the scan found a foreign corp's session and triggered `--resume`, which claude rejects with "No conversation found" because it scopes sessions per project dir. Fix: check only the workspace-specific encoded dir.
- **`pickErrorMessage` missed `errors[]`:** claude's runtime error envelope uses an array field, not the scalar `error`/`message`/`result` the parser checked. Added an array-aware branch so the real reason surfaces.

Bonus: per-dispatch log line recording which continuation flag (`--session-id` or `--resume`) was chosen, so the next encoding surprise is grep-away.

## v2.1.6 — Per-agent model override on claude-code (MERGED, PR #114)

Audit of `claude --help` against our dispatch code. The harness was ignoring `config.json.model` entirely — every claude-code dispatch ran on claude's global default (usually sonnet), regardless of what the agent was configured for at hire. A Planner set to `claude-opus-4-6` would still execute on sonnet, silently.

Fix: before building spawn args, read the agent's workspace `config.json`. When the model is set and provider looks Anthropic (`anthropic`, `claude`, or model name starts with `claude-` / is `sonnet|opus|haiku`), pass `--model <value>` to claude. Non-Anthropic models (e.g., openclaw leftovers) are skipped — claude rejects them, silent fallback to default beats cryptic error.

Third "audit the claude CLI assumptions" finding after v2.1.1 (--session-id vs --resume) and v2.1.2 (--dangerously-skip-permissions). Memory updated (`feedback_dont_guess.md`) so future-us reads `<binary> --help` *before* writing flag strings for new CLI integrations.

## v2.1.5 — Jack session keys deterministic (MERGED, PR #112)

CEO re-introduced itself on every message. Looked like each turn started a fresh session — because it did. Three callers (TUI auto-jack effect, TUI /jack handler, `cc-cli jack`) baked `Date.now()` into the jack session key, so every channel entry / jack invocation derived a new claude UUID, which `claudeSessionFileExists()` couldn't find, which fell back to `--session-id` (creates) instead of `--resume` (continues). Every other dispatcher (autoemon, dreams, slumber, api, router) already used the deterministic `jack:${slug}` form — these three were the only outliers.

Fix: drop the timestamp from all three. Repo-wide grep test pins the rule so a fourth caller can't sneak the pattern back in.

## v2.1.4 — Claude-code text blocks persist (MERGED, PR #110)

A claude response with tool calls produces multiple text blocks (text → tool → text). Before this fix only the FINAL block survived — earlier text vanished after streaming and never came back on channel re-entry. Root cause: ClaudeCodeHarness reported `result.content` from claude's `result` envelope, which only carries the last block. Earlier blocks streamed live but never persisted as JSONL.

Fix: per-text-block persistence. New `text_block_complete` event in the parser fires on every text block boundary; new `onAssistantText` callback in `DispatchCallbacks` lets `/cc/say` persist each block as its own JSONL message via `post()`. Streaming overlay slices past `lastPersistedLength` so it shows only in-flight remainder, no visual duplication. `result.content` now uses cross-block accumulation so callers without per-block awareness (heartbeat, inbox writes) still get full text. Final result write skipped when blocks already covered it.

2 new regression tests pin the contract: multi-block fires `onAssistantText` per block in order; `onToken` stays cross-block (router's offset-tracking still works).

## v2.1.3 — Onboarding hang fix (MERGED, PR #108)

Creating a fresh corp with claude-code picked still showed `"Connecting to your OpenClaw..."` AND actually hung ~10s waiting on an OpenClaw WebSocket connection that would never be used. Two bugs, one fix:

- `connectOpenClawWS` unconditionally attempted the user-gateway connect when `globalConfig.userGateway` was set, regardless of harness. Now gated on `corpHasOpenClawAgent(corpRoot)` — resolves each agent's effective harness (member > corp > 'openclaw') and only connects when at least one agent actually needs it.
- Onboarding status text was keyed on `userGateway` presence only (legacy "CEO is always remote OpenClaw" assumption). Now branches on the selected harness first.

Also extracted `resolveMemberHarness` + `corpHasOpenClawAgent` to `packages/daemon/src/harness-resolve.ts` with 12 regression tests locking the rule. Follow-up: migrate the other two inline harness-resolution sites (daemon.resolveHarnessForAgent + process-manager inline logic) to import from the new module.

## v2.1.2 — Claude-code agent reality check (MERGED, PRs #105–#106)

Two bugs Mark hit the moment v2.1.0 met real use:

- **PR #105 — `--dangerously-skip-permissions`:** claude-code agents hung the moment they tried any tool (Bash/Edit/Write) because claude's default permission mode pauses for interactive approval that nobody's there to give. ClaudeCodeHarness now passes the bypass flag on every dispatch — for autonomous corp agents, autonomous tool use IS the design.
- **PR #106 — Skip OpenClaw gateway when nothing uses it:** a fresh `harness=claude-code` corp was spawning the full OpenClaw process tree at startup, binding a port + ~50MB RSS, for an empty audience. `initCorpGateway` now resolves each agent's harness (member > corp > 'openclaw'), only registers openclaw agents with the gateway, and only starts the gateway when at least one agent needs it. New `'harness'` value in `AgentProcess.mode` for agents dispatched directly through their `AgentHarness` with no gateway slot.

8 new regression tests for the gateway-skip logic. Full suite: 530/530 green.

## v2.1.1 — ClaudeCodeHarness session resume (MERGED, PR #103)

Every second-and-later message in a jack DM with a claude-code agent was failing with `Session ID X is already in use`. Root cause: the harness always passed `--session-id <uuid>` on every dispatch, but claude CLI's `--session-id` means *create* (rejects if UUID exists), not *resume*. Fix: scan `~/.claude/projects/*/` for the session file; use `--session-id` when absent (first dispatch) and `--resume` when present (continuation). Bonus doc alignment so future-us can't make the same false assumption.

## v2.1.0 — Harness UX pass (MERGED, PRs #100–#102)

v2.0.0 made Claude Corp harness-agnostic but only the CLI exposed the choice — the TUI pretended the feature didn't exist. v2.1.0 closes that gap across all three touch points so users configure harnesses without ever reading docs.

- **Onboarding harness step (#100):** after theme picker, a "Where should your CEO think?" screen. Detects what's installed (claude binary + OAuth) and what's configured (provider API keys), shows each option with availability note + fix hint for unavailable ones, persists selection to `Corporation.harness` so the CEO lands on the right substrate at creation.
- **Hire wizard harness step (#101):** new step between model and description. Defaults to "Use corp default (X)" reading fresh from corp.json, lets per-agent overrides pick claude-code or openclaw explicitly. Same detection + fix-hint UX as onboarding.
- **`/harness` modal (#102):** three-screen interactive switcher. List shows every active agent with current harness + status. Select one → picker shows target options with live availability + preview of filesystem changes → confirm runs `reconcileAgentWorkspace` → result screen summarizes renamed / backed-up / written files. Registered as slash command + autocomplete + `/help` entry.

**Shared primitives:**
- `packages/tui/src/utils/harness-detect.ts` — Windows-safe binary resolution via `findExecutableInPath` (exported from `@claudecorp/daemon`), API-key-aware OpenClaw detection, honest fix-hints for unavailable harnesses.
- `scaffoldCorp` accepts an optional `harness` param that persists to `corp.json`.
- 12 new tests for the detection layer (full suite: 511/511 green).

**Design constraints honored:**
- Zero docs required to understand any screen.
- Unavailable options stay selectable — user gets a clear error on first dispatch rather than silent fallback.
- Detection runs lazily (at step entry, not TUI startup) so slow probes don't block name input.

## v2.0.0 — Harness-Agnostic Corps (MERGED, PRs #87–#98)

**The new chapter:** Claude Corp is no longer tied to any single agent runtime. Every agent picks a registered substrate at hire time (or later via `cc-cli agent set-harness`), and the daemon's `HarnessRouter` dispatches each message through the right plug. Same `AgentHarness` contract; any harness that implements it is a first-class citizen.

**Why it matters now:** Anthropic banned OpenClaw subscription auth. Without substrate-agnostic dispatch, users on Claude Max subscriptions (no API key) had no path to run Claude Corp. v2.0.0 makes that path first-class, without losing OpenClaw's provider-agnostic multi-provider support.

### What shipped across the rollout (PRs #87–#98)

| Area | Summary |
|---|---|
| **Harness abstraction** (#87) | `AgentHarness` interface, `OpenClawHarness` wrap (zero-behavior-change default), `HarnessRegistry`, `MockHarness`, lifecycle wiring |
| **Per-agent routing** (#88) | `HarnessRouter`, harness persisted to `config.json` + Member, `/agents` + `/harnesses` APIs, `cc-cli agents` column, `cc-cli agent set-harness`, `cc-cli harness list/health`, `cc-cli inspect` |
| **Claude Code harness** (#89–#93) | `ClaudeCodeHarness` over `claude --print --verbose --output-format stream-json` on OAuth subscription auth, cost tracking, 4 Windows spawn hotfixes (shell quoting, binary resolution, --verbose flag requirement, absolute-cwd handling) |
| **Agent onboarding** (#94) | Harness-aware `defaultRules` + `defaultEnvironment` templates, files on disk renamed to OpenClaw-recognized `AGENTS.md` + `TOOLS.md` (so they finally reach both substrates' system prompts), `buildClaudeMd` template with SOUL preamble + `@./` imports, daemon-startup filename migration, `cc-cli hire --harness` |
| **API bug fixes** (#96–#98) | Three instances of the same bug class — HTTP handlers silently dropping body fields. `/agents/hire` dropped `harness`, `/tasks/create` dropped `projectId`/`blockedBy`/`acceptanceCriteria`, `/projects/create` dropped `displayName`. All fixed + regression tests at the HTTP boundary |
| **Set-harness reconciliation** (this PR) | `cc-cli agent set-harness` now actively re-scaffolds the workspace: migrates legacy filenames with newer-wins conflict resolution (older copy moved to `.backup.<ts>`), writes CLAUDE.md when switching to claude-code, moves CLAUDE.md aside when switching back. Switching harness is now a real migration, not a record-only lie |
| **Doc alignment** | README badge bumped + harness-agnostic framing, ROADMAP top note, CLAUDE.md corp layout, SOUL + workspace fragment + onboard-agent blueprint + planner heartbeat + init/onboarding kickoff messages all updated to the v2.0 filenames |

### Live-verified end-to-end

Hired TestPilot2 with `--harness claude-code` in the hc-test corp, dispatched via `cc-cli say`. Response reflected IDENTITY.md content verbatim — the claude CLI auto-discovered CLAUDE.md, resolved all 11 `@./` imports, and the workspace files reached the system prompt. Proof the full loop works.

### Test suite

499/499 green. New coverage: 63 tests for PR #94, 5 each for the three HTTP-body fixes, 13 for the reconciler. Regression coverage now includes the HTTP boundary seam that was invisible to unit tests before.

- **Casket** — sealed agent workspace: TASKS.md + INBOX.md + WORKLOG.md + STATUS.md auto-generated
- **Dredge** — session recovery fragment, extracts Session Summary from WORKLOG.md
- **Hand** — task assignment verb (`cc-cli hand --task <id> --to <agent>`). Creating = planning, handing = action.
- **Jack** — persistent session mode, DEFAULT for all DMs. Deterministic session keys per agent pair (say:ceo:lead-coder)
- **Clock** — unified timer primitive. 7 daemon clocks registered. Animated /clock TUI view with spinning squares + color cycling
- **Contract** — bundle of tasks inside a Project. draft → active → review → completed/rejected. ContractWatcher auto-triggers Warden
- **Blueprint** — structured playbooks with cc-cli commands. 4 defaults: ship-feature, onboard-agent, run-research, sprint-review
- **Project** — real primitive with scoped agent workspaces (projects/<name>/agents/<agent>/) and project channels

### System Agents (5 auto-hired on bootstrap)
- **CEO** — runs the corp, delegates (falls back to local gateway if remote OpenClaw unavailable)
- **Failsafe** — health monitoring via say() every 5 min
- **Janitor** — git merge placeholder (active when worktrees ship)
- **Warden** — contract review quality gate. Reviews all tasks, checks acceptance criteria, approves/rejects
- **Herald** — Haiku narrator. Writes NARRATION.md every 5 min. Injected into STATUS.md + Corp Home banner

### Communication
- **Persistent sessions** — ALL say() calls use deterministic session keys. Every agent-to-agent conversation has memory
- **@mention dispatch** — human mentions bypass inbox (instant), agent mentions go to inbox queue
- **cc-cli say** — instant direct message with persistent session
- **Task DM dispatch** — tasks handed via Hand arrive in agent's DM
- **Inbox priority queue** — one task at a time, priority sorted. Persists to inbox-state.json across daemon restarts

### Monitoring & Analytics
- **ClockManager** — 10 daemon clocks registered (7 core + 3 recovery). Fire counts, error tracking, overlap guard
- **Analytics Engine** — tasks created/completed/failed, dispatches, messages, per-agent utilization/streaks. Persists to analytics.json
- **Corp Vitals (STATUS.md)** — per-agent: who's online + current work + your metrics + recent completions + Herald narration + clock errors
- **cc-cli activity/feed** — 4-section dashboard: PROBLEMS, AGENTS, TASKS, EVENTS
- **cc-cli stats** — beefed with analytics: top performer, utilization %, streaks, dispatches per agent

### TUI
- **Corp Home** — agent grid + Herald banner + activity feed + task summary
- **/clock view** — animated spinning squares with color cycling, progress bars, exact fire times, live clock
- **Sectioned Ctrl+K palette** — Views / Channels / Agents (hierarchy as DM navigator)
- **Jack mode default** — auto-jacks on DM entry. /unjack for async (deprecated)
- **DM mode onboarding** — choice at corp creation with async deprecated warning
- **Tool call details** — shows actual file paths + commands + result tree with └
- **Corp selector** — scans filesystem for all corps (not just index)
- **Inline streaming** — agent responses stream directly in chat (not preview panel), multi-agent simultaneous
- **First-boot restart warning** — recommends TUI restart after corp creation for clean agent init

### Fragments (10 rewritten for v0.10.x primitives)
- workspace, task-execution, delegation, receiving-delegation, agent-communication, cc-cli, inbox, context, back-reporting, blocker-escalation

## v1.1.0 — Harness Abstraction (MERGED, PR #87)

**Motivation:** Anthropic banned OpenClaw subscription auth; Claude Corp needs to run on Claude Code's OAuth auth. First step: abstract the dispatch layer so per-agent harness selection becomes possible.

- ✅ `AgentHarness` interface — single contract (dispatch, healthCheck, teardown, cost) over any agent runtime
- ✅ `OpenClawHarness` wraps existing dispatch (backward-compat default, zero behavior change)
- ✅ `HarnessRegistry` — plugin-style registration keyed by harness name
- ✅ `MockHarness` — deterministic in-process harness for testing
- ✅ Daemon lifecycle integration: router @mention, heartbeat inbox, `/say` API all go through the harness
- ✅ Optional `harness` field added to `Member` + `Corporation` + `AgentSpec` types
- ✅ Parameterized AgentHarness contract test applied to both real + mock harnesses

## v1.1.3 — Per-Agent Harness Routing (MERGED, PR #88)

- ✅ `HarnessRouter` — delegates each dispatch to the agent's configured harness (fallback to default)
- ✅ `hireAgent` + `setupAgentWorkspace` persist resolved harness to `config.json` + Member record
- ✅ `/agents` API returns resolved harness per agent; `cc-cli agents` shows harness column
- ✅ `/harnesses` API lists registered harnesses + their health
- ✅ `cc-cli agent set-harness --agent <id> --harness <name>` — switch substrate on a live agent
- ✅ `cc-cli harness list` / `cc-cli harness health` — per-harness diagnostics
- ✅ `cc-cli inspect` shows resolved harness per agent

## v1.1.4 — Claude Code Harness (MERGED, PRs #89-93)

- ✅ `ClaudeCodeHarness` — AgentHarness over the `claude` CLI using OAuth subscription auth (not API key, since Anthropic banned OpenClaw subscription usage)
- ✅ Streams JSON events from `claude --print --verbose --output-format stream-json` into Claude Corp's unified event stream
- ✅ Per-dispatch + cumulative cost tracking
- ✅ Registered alongside `openclaw` harness at daemon startup
- ✅ 4 Windows spawn hotfixes:
  - Shell quoting + `cmd.exe` metacharacter handling via `quoteForWindowsCmd`
  - `claude` binary resolved to absolute path at init (PATH walk + PATHEXT honored), no shell mode
  - `--verbose` flag added (required by claude when combining `--print` with stream-json output)
  - `resolveWorkspace` handles absolute `agentDir` (matches api.ts convention)

## v1.2.0 — Claude Code Agent Onboarding (MERGED, PR #94)

**The unlock:** OpenClaw's workspace bootstrap loader auto-injects files only when the basename is in a hardcoded set (`AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `MEMORY.md`). Claude Corp had been writing `RULES.md` + `ENVIRONMENT.md` — silently dropped. Fix: rename on disk so both OpenClaw auto-load + Claude Code `@import` converge on the same handles.

- ✅ Harness-aware templates: `defaultRules` + `defaultEnvironment` branch on harness, name substrate-specific tool vocab (`Read`/`Write`/`Edit`/`Bash` vs `read`/`exec`/`process`)
- ✅ OpenClaw-recognized basenames on disk: writes `AGENTS.md` + `TOOLS.md` (internal template names keep `rules`/`environment` for semantic clarity)
- ✅ `migrateAgentWorkspaceFilenames` — idempotent rename of legacy `RULES.md` / `ENVIRONMENT.md` on corp + project-scoped agents, runs at daemon startup; flags conflicts, doesn't clobber
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` per Claude Code agent: SOUL embodiment preamble (verbatim OpenClaw phrasing so the agent embodies SOUL across substrates) + `@./` imports of always-on identity files + current state (STATUS/INBOX/TASKS) + read-on-demand footer for BRAIN/observations/WORKLOG
- ✅ `cc-cli hire --harness <claude-code|openclaw>` — picks substrate at agent creation
- ✅ 63 new tests across 5 files; full suite 472/472 passing

## Planned but NOT yet built

## v0.11.0 + v0.11.1 — Loops & Crons (MERGED)

- ✅ Loops — interval-based recurring commands (@every 5m, 30s, 2h)
- ✅ Crons — schedule-based jobs via croner (100% correctness): @daily, @hourly, 0 9 * * 1
- ✅ Both persist to clocks.json — survive daemon restarts via rehydration
- ✅ Both visible in /clock view with animated spinners + progress bars
- ✅ Channel-bound output — loop/cron output appears in the channel where created
- ✅ DM auto-assign — /loop in a DM auto-targets the agent
- ✅ Complete/Dismiss/Delete lifecycle (C/X/D keys in /clock, CLI + TUI commands)
- ✅ ScheduledClock type extends Clock with expression, command, targetAgent, maxRuns, channelId
- ✅ Schedule parser — @every 5m, @daily, raw cron, formatIntervalMs, formatCountdown
- ✅ cronstrue converts cron expressions to English ("At 9:00 AM, only on Monday")
- ✅ LoopManager + CronManager with watchdog timeouts, maxRuns auto-complete
- ✅ ClockManager.registerExternal() for cron observability bridge
- ✅ API: POST /loops, POST /crons, DELETE /clocks/:slug, POST complete/dismiss
- ✅ CLI: cc-cli loop create/list/complete/dismiss/delete, cc-cli cron create/list/complete/dismiss/delete
- ✅ TUI: /loop, /cron chat commands with DM auto-assign
- ✅ CEO auto-starts OpenClaw if remote gateway is dead

### Future — Escalation
- Severity-routed blockers: P0 → Founder, P1 → CEO, P2 → team leader
- `cc-cli escalate --severity P1 "description"`
- Tracked escalation beads routed through hierarchy

### Future — Scheduler
- Capacity governor: `cc-cli config set scheduler.max_agents 5`
- Caps concurrent dispatches to prevent API rate limit exhaustion
- Queues excess work, feeds when slot opens

### Future — Project Worktrees
- Per-project git isolation (not per-agent — that was wrong)
- Each agent working on a project gets `projects/<name>/wt/<agent-slug>`
- Janitor merges worktrees back to project main branch
- Git worktree methods already in shared/git.ts (createWorktree, mergeWorktree, etc.)

### ~~Future — Agent Dreams~~ SHIPPED v0.12.0
- ~~Warm-start idle behavior via heartbeat context pre-loading~~
- Shipped as 4-phase memory consolidation (Orient → Gather → Consolidate → Prune)

### ~~Future — Herald on Haiku 4.5~~ SHIPPED
- Herald runs on corp gateway (Haiku) by default. Per-agent model routing works.
- Opus agents (CEO, Planner) route to remote gateway. Haiku agents use corp gateway.

### Future — Proactive Mode (KAIROS-lite)
- Agents act without being prompted — monitor channels, detect patterns, take initiative
- Adapted from Claude Code's KAIROS system
- Next major feature after v0.14.3

### Future — Corp Buddy (Tamagotchi)
- Per-corp mascot that reflects corp health/mood
- Adapted from Claude Code's buddy system

### Future — Founder Away (AFK Mode)
- CEO autonomy while user sleeps — autonomous task execution, morning briefing
- Queue management, escalation deferral

### Future — Token Budgets
- Per-agent cost limits, usage tracking, budget alerts

## Architecture Notes

### Key Design Decisions (v0.10.x)
- **Jack is default** — all communication uses persistent OpenClaw sessions
- **Hand separates planning from action** — creating a task ≠ starting work
- **Contracts live inside Projects** — Projects are containers, Contracts are work units
- **Blueprints are documentation, not code** — CEO follows them as playbooks
- **Warden signs off** — nothing closes without quality review
- **Herald narrates** — NARRATION.md → STATUS.md + Corp Home banner
- **Clock unifies timers** — every setInterval is observable + pauseable
- **Casket is the agent's world** — 9+ files, daemon generates TASKS/INBOX/WORKLOG/STATUS
- **Inbox queues one task at a time** — priority sorted, blocked tasks held, persisted across restarts
- **Analytics track everything** — per-agent utilization, streaks, dispatch counts

### Naming Convention for Primitives
| Name | What | Verb |
|------|------|------|
| Casket | Sealed agent workspace | "Check your casket" |
| Dredge | Session recovery | "Dredge your last session" |
| Hand | Task assignment | "Hand it to @agent" |
| Jack | Live persistent session | "Jack into the CEO" |
| Clock | Timer/interval primitive | "Check the clocks" |
| Contract | Task bundle with goal | "Open a contract" |
| Blueprint | Workflow playbook | "Follow the blueprint" |
| Warden | Quality gate agent | "Warden reviews" |
| Herald | Narrator agent | "Herald says" |
